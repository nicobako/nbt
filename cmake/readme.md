# cmake

This directory contains *cmake* scripts.

**Note** - A *cmake script* is not the same as a *CMakeLists.txt*.
CMakeLists.txt are used in the CMake build toolchain, and there
must be only one in each directory/subdirectory.
A cmake script contains cmake function/target definitions
and there can be multiple cmake scripts pre directory.
